# Caves-of-Qud-Mod---Adding-My-Dog-and-Bird-as-Pets-
Basically adding my Great Dane, and in memoriam, a gigantic quantum vortex parakeet.
Basic concepts came from [Arendeths Null-Falcon mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2626636825), which is awesome mod, but I wanna see if I can get the whole animated material part to work on the tile to give the impression of the parakeet flying, and the dog do dog thing.  Dog was kinda haphazardly put together with [Zamuri Wolf Companion](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=333640&searchtext=zamuri&childpublishedfileid=0&browsesort=textsearch&section=items&created_date_range_filter_start=0&created_date_range_filter_end=0&updated_date_range_filter_start=0&updated_date_range_filter_end=0) and also some experiment/staring at decompiled code.

haven't finished or tested.

EDIT.  Yea... Needs more finish and tests.
